*** Extended Authentication Component for CakePHP ***

This component is derived from the standard AuthComponent
and adds so-called "remember me feature" to the base class.

You can simply use this component as substitute for the AuthComponent.
Only two things are needed along with this component as follows:

  (1) Special table named 'auto_logins'.
  (2) Check box named 'rememberme' on your login form.

The 'auto_logins' table is something like this:
  create table auto_logins (
    id                int(11) not null auto_increment primary key,
    user_id           int(11),
    expires           datetime,
    token             varchar(64),
    created           datetime,
    modified          datetime
  );
  alter table auto_logins add index (token);
  alter table auto_logins add index (expires);

This component doesn't save any user information in cookies.
It saves the information in the 'auto_logins' table.
